The Odin Project - Project: Recipes

The Odin Project (TOP) is an open source coding curriculum to learn full stack developing.

This is my first project from TOP's curriculum. I'm just starting to learn web development, and this project is about building a basic recipe website using HTML.

The website has a main index page that links to a few recipes. I'll come back later when I learn CSS to make it look nice.

## What I'm practicing
- Creating HTML pages
- Linking between pages
- Using images
- Making lists (ingredients and steps)
- Basic Git commits and pushing to GitHub
